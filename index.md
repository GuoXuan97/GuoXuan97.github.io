[Classifying Disaster Tweets with Voting Classifier](https://github.com/GuoXuan97/Kaggle-Project-NLP-with-Disaster-Tweets/blob/master/nlp-with-disaster-tweets.ipynb)

Disaster relief organisations and news agencies programmatically monitor Twitter to receive real-time information about emergencies and disasters. In this Kaggle competition project, I developed a voting classifier that trains on an ensemble of models (Multinomial Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, Random Forest) to predict whether a given tweet is about a disaster. The trained classifier has an F1 score of 0.80294 on the test set (Kaggle public score).

[Using Data Analytics Tools to Increase Real Estate Management Profits](https://github.com/GuoXuan97/Increasing-Real-Estate-Management-Profits)
<img src="images/Dashboard.jpg?raw=true"/><br>
This is my submission for the Capstone Project of the Coursera Specialization "Excel to MySQL: Analytic Techniques for Business" offered by Duke University. The objective is to convince the fictitious property management company to increase its profits by converting some of their properties to short-term rental properties. Firstly, I used MySQL to extract relevant data from a real estate database. I then used Excel to identify opportunities to increase revenue, maximise profits and manage risks. Finally, I created a Tableau dashboard to perform sensitivity analysis.

[Investigating the Appeal of Right-Wing Politics using LDA Topic Modelling](https://github.com/GuoXuan97/Investigating-the-Appeal-of-Right-Wing-Politics-using-LDA-Topic-Modelling/blob/master/FinalProject.ipynb)<br>

In this project, I performed computational text analysis and LDA topic modelling on opinion editorials and transcripts of speeches / interviews by right-wing leaders. Specifically, I studied the election of Donald Trump, Brexit and the surprise victory of Scott Morrison's conservative government in Australiaâ€™s federal election. I am interested in summarising the narratives that right-wing leaders construct to shore up audience support. This project was submitted for credit for UC Berkeley's DIGHUM101 Practicing the Digital Humanities and scored A.
