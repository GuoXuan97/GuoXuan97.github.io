Disaster relief organisations and news agencies programmatically monitor Twitter to receive real-time information about emergencies and disasters. In this project, I developed a voting classifier that trains on an ensemble of models (Multinomial Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, Random Forest) to predict whether a given tweet is about a disaster. The trained classifier has an F1 score of 0.80294 on the test set (Kaggle public score).

Recent years have seen right-wing movements gaining traction, particularly in the West. Generally, right-wing politics is associated with nationalism, populism and protectionism. I performed computational text analysis and LDA topic modelling on opinion editorials and transcripts of speeches / interviews by right-wing leaders. Specifically, I studied the election of Donald Trump, Brexit and the surprise victory of Scott Morrison's conservative government in Australia’s federal election. I am interested to find out about the narratives that right-wing leaders construct to shore up audience support.
