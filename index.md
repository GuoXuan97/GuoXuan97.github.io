Disaster relief organisations and news agencies programmatically monitor Twitter to receive real-time information about emergencies and disasters. In this project, I developed a voting classifier that trains on an ensemble of models (Multinomial Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, Random Forest) to predict whether a given tweet is about a disaster. The trained classifier has an F1 score of 0.80294 on the test set (Kaggle public score).

### School Projects

In this project, I performed computational text analysis and LDA topic modelling on opinion editorials and transcripts of speeches / interviews by right-wing leaders. Specifically, I studied the election of Donald Trump, Brexit and the surprise victory of Scott Morrison's conservative government in Australiaâ€™s federal election. I am interested in summarising the narratives that right-wing leaders construct to shore up audience support. Interesting findings were made regarding immigration and the juxtaposition of an elite (and sometimes corrupt) political class against the rest of the populace.
