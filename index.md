I performed computational text analysis and LDA topic modelling on opinion editorials and transcripts of speeches / interviews by right-wing leaders. Specifically, I studied the election of Donald Trump, Brexit and the surprise victory of Scott Morrison's conservative government in Australiaâ€™s federal election. I am interested in summarising the narratives that right-wing leaders construct to shore up audience support. This project was submitted for credit for UC Berkeley's DIGHUM101 Practicing the Digital Humanities and scored A.

In this Kaggle competition organised by Jane Street, I developed a trading model to identify arbitrage opportunities to "buy low and sell high". I used XGBoost to build a classifier that decides whether to execute a trade or pass on it. The hyperparameters of the classifier are tuned using Optuna and the model achieved an accuracy score of almost 70%.

The training set used for this project comprises 42,000 images from the MNIST dataset - the de facto "hello world" dataset of computer vision. The goal of this Kaggle competition is to build a deep learning model to recognize handwritten digits (0-9). To achieve this objective, I built a convolutional neural network (CNN) using Keras.

Disaster relief organisations and news agencies programmatically monitor Twitter to receive real-time information about emergencies and disasters. In this Kaggle competition, I developed a voting classifier that trains on an ensemble of models (Multinomial Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, Random Forest) to predict whether a given tweet is about a disaster.

[Using Data Analytics Tools to Increase Real Estate Management Profits](https://github.com/GuoXuan97/Increasing-Real-Estate-Management-Profits)</a>
<img src="images/Dashboard.jpg?raw=true"/> <br>
This is my submission for the Capstone Project of the Coursera Specialization "Excel to MySQL: Analytic Techniques for Business". Firstly, I used MySQL to extract relevant data from a real estate database. I then used Excel to identify opportunities to increase revenue, maximise profits and manage risks. Finally, I created a Tableau dashboard to perform financial sensitivity analysis. Specifically, I illustrated the impact on net cash flow and net profit when default parameters were changed. Click [here](https://public.tableau.com/profile/guo.xuan.wong#!/vizhome/WatershedDashboard_15979878979550/Dashboard1?publish=yes) to interact with the dashboard.
