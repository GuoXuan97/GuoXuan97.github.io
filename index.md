I performed computational text analysis and LDA topic modelling on opinion editorials and transcripts of speeches / interviews by right-wing leaders. Specifically, I studied the election of Donald Trump, Brexit and the surprise victory of Scott Morrison's conservative government in Australia’s federal election. I am interested in summarising the narratives that right-wing leaders construct to shore up audience support. This project was submitted for credit for UC Berkeley's DIGHUM101 Practicing the Digital Humanities and scored A.

Disaster relief organisations and news agencies programmatically monitor Twitter to receive real-time information about emergencies and disasters. In this Kaggle competition, I developed a voting classifier that trains on an ensemble of models (Multinomial Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, Random Forest) to predict whether a given tweet is about a disaster.

The training set used for this project comprises 42,000 images from the MNIST dataset - the de facto "hello world" dataset of computer vision. The goal of this Kaggle competition is to build a deep learning model to recognize handwritten digits (0-9). To achieve this objective, I built a convolutional neural network (CNN) using Keras.

The Covid-19 pandemic led many to worry about a "lost generation" or "lockdown generation". I investigate if youths are disproportionately affected by the Covid-19 pandemic in the job market, using evidence from the European Union. Concretely, I use a difference-in-differences approach to isolate the differential impact of the pandemic on youth unemployment (vis-à-vis adult unemployment) in European countries.

This is my submission for the Capstone Project of the Coursera Specialization "Excel to MySQL: Analytic Techniques for Business" offered by Duke University. The objective is to convince the fictitious property management company to enter the short term rental market. Firstly, I used MySQL to extract relevant data from a real estate database. I then used Excel to identify opportunities to increase revenue, maximise profits and manage risks. Finally, I created a Tableau dashboard to perform financial sensitivity analysis. Click [here](https://public.tableau.com/profile/guo.xuan.wong#!/vizhome/WatershedDashboard_15979878979550/Dashboard1?publish=yes) to interact with the dashboard.
